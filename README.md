# 🛡️ Securing AWS Infrastructure: Terraform & Trivy Integration

### *Automated Security Hardening & Continuous Compliance*

This project demonstrates a security-first approach to deploying a **Next.js 15.5.5** application on AWS. By integrating **Trivy** into a **Jenkins CI/CD pipeline**, I identified critical misconfigurations in Terraform scripts and remediated them before deployment to ensure a hardened production environment.

---

## 🔍 Trivy Findings & Remediation Summary

I utilized Trivy IaC scanning to audit the Terraform code. Below are the key security improvements made:

* **Restricted SSH Access**
    * **Issue:** SSH was open to `0.0.0.0/0`, enabling brute-force attack risks.
    * **Remediation:** Restricted access to a **Trusted Admin IP** (SSM is recommended for production).
* **Enforced IMDSv2**
    * **Issue:** IMDSv1 exposure enabled potential IAM credential theft via SSRF.
    * **Remediation:** Enforced **IMDSv2** (Session-oriented tokens) for all EC2 instances.
* **Encrypted EBS Root Volumes**
    * **Issue:** Unencrypted volumes exposed sensitive data at rest.
    * **Remediation:** Enabled **AES-256 Encryption** on all root EBS volumes.
* **Least-Privilege Egress Rules**
    * **Issue:** Unrestricted outbound traffic allowed for potential data exfiltration.
    * **Remediation:** Locked down security groups to allow only necessary outbound traffic.
